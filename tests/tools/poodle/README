poodle is a client-server tool to run many tcp connections simultaneously.

The client is the sending side. Use -h for help

Build:
c++ poodle.cpp -lpthread -o poodle -g -O2

Build with PP kernel:
c++ ./poodle.cpp -lpthread -o poodle -g -O2 -DUSE_PP -I{PP kernel sys dir}


Example:

Server side(server is 11.11.11.2):
poodle -s

Client side that will open 20000 connections at 10kB/s per connection using 8 threads, ramping up 2000 connections  a second and renewing each connection after 3 minutes
./poodle -c 11.11.11.2 -C 20000 -b 10 -r 8 -n 2000 -t 180

Same client using PP(you must build first with PP kernel):
poodle -c 11.11.11.2 -C 20000 -b 10 -r 8 -n 2000 -t 180 -P

Enjoy and call me if you need assistance.
